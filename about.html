            <h3>History</h3>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">In 1872 it was partially levelled and then used intermittently as a store for timber, coal, leather goods or marble (either in sheds or open air) along with a series of small stables.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The site remained disused until 1912, when a marble yard operated, until the construction of the Mercantile Hotel in 1914.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">In 1989-90 allowed the upper floor rooms to provide additional bedrooms for the hotel, and further work connected to the ground floor rooms of the shop and hotel in 1993.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The Mercantile Hotel at 25 George Street has continued its use as a hotel to the present day, with little change to its external fabric but with some ground floor rearrangement of the public spaces, and some updating of the accommodation of the upper floors.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">The three storey building, a restrained example of Federation Free Style, is of brick wall construction with timber floors and a malthoid roof.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The Hotel is located on the wedge shaped block that marks the junction of George Street with Gloucester Walk, and the building is L shaped with the shop having a wider footprint and with small rear yards</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">At the north end, the three storeys are reduced to two, and a pair of large old fig trees, low stone retaining walls and curved steps leading down from the Walk to the north forecourt add to the pleasing aspect of this key frontage.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <h3>Heritage Listing</h3>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">The Mercantile Hotel and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and aesthetic cultural values.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The Mercantile Hotel has local historical significance as one of the more intact survivors of late-19th and early-20th century Rocks pubs, having operated continuously since its opening in 1914 and retaining much of its original character, fabric and functions.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The Hotel is an example of the early 20th century work of the once leading Sydney architectural practice of Spain and Cosh.</li>
